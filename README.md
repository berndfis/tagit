tagit
=====

A Python [Mutagen] audio file Tagger for folder based music archives.

Motivation
----------
A long story which comes later.

Features
--------
Will bee added soon.

Requirements
------------
- A folder based music archive, recommendation is to have on CD represented by one folder.
- Audio file names in the notation <track>-<titel>-<artist>.<extension> or 
  <titel>-<artist>.<extension> for doing a file to tag tagging. 
- An album cover image in jpg format, named "cover.jpg" is required in each CD folder
  to tag the album cover.
- An album info file in each CD music folder in Python ConfigParser style is
required for tagging album, albumartist, date, genre, discnumber and totaldiscs.

Example album.info file content:
```
[albuminfo]
album = Thriller
albumartist = Michael Jackson
date = 1982
genre = Pop
discnumber = 1
totaldiscs = 1
```

Usage
-----
```
usage: tagit.py [-h] [-v] [-s SINGLE | -a]
                [-u {all,album,albumartist,cover,genre}] [-i]

audio file archive tagger for mp3 and m4a

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message & exit
  -v, --version         show programs version number & exit
  -s SINGLE, --single SINGLE single directory, input must be the folder name
  -a, --archive         complete audio file directory archive, starting from the 
                        current directory
  -u {all,album,albumartist,cover,genre}, 
      --update {all,album,albumartist,cover,genre}
                        updates only the defined tag fields, 
                        all tags all fields form album.info plus cover
  -i, --info            gives a verbose output about the tagging status
```
-u is a blind option so far.


Tag Mapping Table
-----------------

The following tables describes the tag maps I have used in my code
for internal tag names, iTunes (m4a) and ID3v2 (mp3).

Reference: [MusicBrainz Picard Mapping]

| Internal Name | MP4 (iTunes) | MP3 (ID3v2 4.0) 
|---------------|--------------|-----------------
| tracknumber   | trkn         | TRCK            
| totaltracks   | trkn         | TRCK         
| title         | \xa9nam      | TIT2       
| artist        | \xa9ART      | TPE1
| album         | \xa9alb      | TALB        
| date          | \xa9day      | TDRC        
| genre         | \xa9gen      | TCON
| albumartist   | aART         | TPE2          
| discnumber    | disk         | TPOS
| totaldiscs    | disk         | TPOS
| cover         | covr         | APIC


Coding Style
------------
Even though I'm mainly used to write code in a proprietary Lisp dialect
I tried to write pythonic code according to:
- [Style Guide for Python Code]
- [The Zen of Python]
