=====

A Python [Mutagen] audio file tagger for folder based music archives.

Description
-----------

Post ripping audio file tagger for folder based music archives.
Developed for cleanup of folder based audio file archives and for post-ripp
tagging e.g. after ripped with [abcde].

Features
--------
* mp3 and m4a (AAC) support.
* Ability to tag complete folder based music archives.
* Single folder tagging support as well.
* iTunes recognized tags.
* Embeds album cover.
* Informative tagging output.
* Folder renaming, for common folder notation.

Requirements
------------
* A folder based music archive, recommendation is to have on CD represented by one folder.
* Audio file names in the notation ```<track>-<titel>-<artist>.<extension>``` or 
  ```<titel>-<artist>.<extension>``` for doing a file to tag tagging. 
* An album cover image in jpg format, named *cover.jpg* is required in each CD folder
  to tag the album cover.
* An album info file named *album.info* in each CD music folder in Python ConfigParser style is
  required for tagging album, albumartist, date, genre, discnumber and totaldiscs.

Example *album.info* file content for a single artist folder:
```
[albuminfo]
album = Thriller
albumartist = Michael Jackson
date = 1982
genre = Pop
discnumber = 1
totaldiscs = 1
```

albumartist = Various Artists
date = 2003
genre = Soul
discnumber = 1
totaldiscs = 1
```

Tag Mapping Table
-----------------

The following tables describes the tag maps I have used in my code
for internal tag names, iTunes (m4a) and ID3v2 (mp3).

Good Other Stuff
----------------
* [neroAacEncoder] my AAC (m4a) encoder choice.
* [abcde] the best Linux CD ripper, command line only, but who needs more.
* If you are looking for a tagger with a great graphical UI
